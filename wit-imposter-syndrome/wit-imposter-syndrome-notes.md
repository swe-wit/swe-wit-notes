### What is imposter syndrome?

**Imposter syndrome** was first identified in 1978 by psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes. They defined it as a tendency of high-performing women in academic settings to underestimate their own abilities, feel like their successes were due to mistakes or luck, and believe themselves to be "intellectual phonies."

In their study, Clance and Imes interviewed women in academic positions, primarily professors, graduate, and undergraduate students. They summarize that

> We have been amazed at the self-perpetuating nature of the impostor phenomenon — with the pervasiveness and longevity of the impostor feelings of our high achieving women, with their continual discounting of their own abilities and persistent fear of failure. We have not found repeated successes alone sufficient to break the cycle.

Some relevant quotes:

- *One woman professor said, “I’m not good enough to be on the faculty here. Some mistake was made in the selection process.”*
- *Another, the chairperson of her department, said, “Obviously I’m in this position because my abilities have been overestimated.”*
- *Another women with two master’s degrees, a PhD., and numerous publications to her credit considered herself unqualified to teach remedial college classes in her field.*

### Why does imposter syndrome disproportionately affect womxn in STEM?

Imposter syndrome is a universal feeling. An individual can experience imposter syndrome because of their own personality traits and background, such as perfectionism or coming from a competitive family. But certain demographics and circumstances make a person more likely to experience imposter syndrome:

- identifying as a womxn, or
- being a racial or ethnic minority.

This is because humans largely measure their own successes based on immediate context (your peers). Being a part of the majority allows you to easily attribute your success to a quality inherent in yourself. But since gender and racial minorities are unable to do so, they project these causes outward to external causes: luck or mistakes. 

Those who are

- studying a STEM field, or
- deeply involved in academia

also have a greater chance of identifying with imposter syndrome. Since the intellectual bar is set higher in these circumstances, it is easier to put yourself down by comparison. 

### How to recognize imposter syndrome

*Overcoming Imposter Syndrome* by Gill Corkindale identifies common sentiments by those with imposter syndrome:

1. *I must not fail.*

    Failing is not seen as an opportunity to learn; rather, the consequences are seen as being found out as a fraud.

2. *I feel like a fake.*

    Those with imposter syndrome feel they have given an exterior impression of competence that is actually unfounded.

3. *It's all down to luck.*

    Success is often attributed to chance, rather than personal ability or effort.

4. *Success is no big deal.*

    Downplaying personal successes is common, and is often attributed to the help of others or the quality of being "advantaged" (e.g., *I am successful **because** I am a minority*). 

### How to combat imposter syndrome

1. Recognize it! Be conscious of your tendencies. ✔
2. Join a minority group or organization. ✔
3. Celebrate your own successes. 
4. Keep an open perspective on where you are on your academic and professional path.
